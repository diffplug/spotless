This build uses Gradle Build Scans to gather statistics, share information about
failures, environmental issues, dependencies resolved during the build and more.
Build scans will be published after each build, if you accept the terms of
service, and in particular the privacy policy.

Please read

    https://gradle.com/terms-of-service
    https://gradle.com/legal/privacy

and then:

  - set the `SPOTLESS_GRADLE_SCANS_ACCEPT` to `yes`/`no` if you agree with/refuse the TOS
  - or create the ${acceptFile} file with `yes`/`no` in it if you agree with/refuse

    echo 'yes' >> ${acceptFile}

    or

    echo 'no' >> ${acceptFile}

And we'll not bother you again. Note that build scans are only made public if
you share the URL at the end of the build.
