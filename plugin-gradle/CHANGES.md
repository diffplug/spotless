# spotless-plugin-gradle releases

We adhere to the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format (starting after version `3.27.0`).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
* Eclipse-WTP formatter (web tools platform, not java) could encounter errors in parallel multiproject builds [#492](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/492). Fixed for Eclipse-WTP formatter Eclipse version 4.13.0 (default version).

## [3.27.2] - 2020-03-05
* Add tests to `SpecificFilesTest` to fix [#529](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/529)
* If you applied spotless to a subproject, but not to the root project, then on Gradle 6+ you would get the deprecation warning `Using method Project#afterEvaluate(Action) when the project is already evaluated has been deprecated.`  This has now been fixed. ([#506](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/506))

## [3.27.1] - 2020-01-14
### Fixed
* `licenseHeader` and `licenseHeaderFile` accidentally returned a package-private config object, which is now public, fixes ([#505](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/505)).

## [3.27.0] - 2020-01-01
* Added method `FormatExtension.createIndependentTask(String taskName)` which allows creating a Spotless task outside of the `check`/`apply` lifecycle.  See [javadoc](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/91ed7203994e52058ea6c2e0f88d023ed290e433/plugin-gradle/src/main/java/com/diffplug/gradle/spotless/FormatExtension.java#L613-L639) for details. ([#500](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/500))
* Running `clean` and `spotlessCheck` during a parallel build could cause exceptions, fixed by ([#501](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/501)).
* Fixed Gradle 7 deprecation warnings that started being emitted in Gradle 6. ([#503](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/503))
  * Even if you're using a pre-6.0 version of Gradle, you will probably see small performance and stability improvements. The PR above finally fixed the root problems of ([#372](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/372)).

## [3.26.1] - 2019-11-27
* Revert the change in console display of errors from 3.26.0 ([#485](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/485)) because [of these problems](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/485#issuecomment-552925932).
* Bugfix: Fix NPE in EclipseXmlFormatterStepImpl ([#489](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/489))

## [3.26.0] - 2019-11-11
* Fix project URLs in poms. ([#478](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/478))
* Fix `ImportSorter` crashing with empty files. ([#474](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/474))
  * Fixes [#305](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/305) StringIndexOutOfBoundsException for empty Groovy file when performing importOrder
* Bugfix: CDT version `4.12.0` now properly uses `9.8`, whereas before it used `9.7`. ([#482](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/482#discussion_r341380884))
* Updated default eclipse-wtp from 4.12.0 to 4.13.0 ([#482](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/482)).
* Updated default eclipse-groovy from 4.12.0 to 4.13.0 ([#482](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/482)).
* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.12.0 to 4.13.0 ([#482](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/482)).
* Updated default eclipse-cdt from 4.12.0 to 4.13.0 ([#482](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/482)).
* Bump default version of KtLint from `0.34.2` to `0.35.0`. ([#473](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/473))
* Several improvements to the console display of formatting errors. ([#465](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/465))
    * Visualize \r and \n as ␍ and ␊ when possible ([#465](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/465))
    * Make end-of-lines visible when file contains whitespace and end-of-line issues at the same time ([#465](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/465))
    * Print actual diff line instead of "1 more lines that didn't fit" ([#467](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/467))

## [3.25.0] - 2019-10-06
* Spotless no longer breaks configuration avoidance for other tasks (specifically the `check` task and all of its dependees) ([#463](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/463)).
  * Important change: **Formerly, Spotless did not create its tasks until the `afterEvaluate` phase.  Spotless now creates them as soon as the plugin is applied**, and it creates the format-specific tasks as soon as the formats are defined.  There is no performance degradation associated with this change, and it makes configuring Spotless easier.
* Add support for ktlint `0.34+`, and bump default version from `0.32.0` to `0.34.2`. ([#469](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/469))

## [3.24.3] - 2019-09-23
* Update jgit from `5.3.2.201906051522-r` to `5.5.0.201909110433-r`. ([#445](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/445))
  * Fixes [#410](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/410) AccessDeniedException in MinGW/GitBash.
  * Also fixes occasional [hang on NFS due to filesystem timers](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/407#issuecomment-514824364).
* Eclipse-based formatters used to leave temporary files around ([#447](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/447)). This is now fixed, but only for eclipse 4.12+, no back-port to older Eclipse formatter versions is planned. ([#451](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/451))
* Fixed a bad but simple bug in `paddedCell()` ([#455](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/455))
    * if a formatter was behaving correctly on a given file (was idempotent)
    * but the file was not properly formatted
    * `spotlessCheck` would improperly say "all good" even though `spotlessApply` would properly change them
    * combined with up-to-date checking, could lead to even more confusing results,
     ([#338](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/338))
    * Fixed now!
* When you specify `targetExclude()`, spotless no longer silently removes `build` directories from the exclusion ([#457](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/457)).
* Bumped `scalafmt` default version from `1.1.0` to `2.0.1`, since there are [bugs](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/454) in the old default ([#458](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/458)).

## [3.24.2] - 2019-08-19
* Fixed `Warning deprecated usage found: Using the incremental task API without declaring any outputs has been deprecated.` that started appearing in Gradle 5.5 ([#434](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/434)).

## [3.24.1] - 2019-08-12
* Fixes class loading issue with Java 9+ ([#426](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/426)).

## [3.24.0] - 2019-07-29
* Updated default eclipse-wtp from 4.8.0 to 4.12.0 ([#423](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/423)).
* Updated default eclipse-groovy from 4.10 to 4.12.0 ([#423](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/423)).
* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.11.0 to 4.12.0 ([#423](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/423)).
* Updated default eclipse-cdt from 4.11.0 to 4.12.0 ([#423](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/423)).
    * **KNOWN BUG - accidentally published CDT 9.7 rather than 9.8 - fixed in 3.26.0**
* Added new maven coordinates for scalafmt 2.0.0+, maintains backwards compatability ([#415](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/415))

## [3.23.1] - 2019-06-17
* Fixes incorrect M2 cache directory path handling of Eclipse based formatters ([#401](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/401))
* Update jgit from `4.9.0.201710071750-r` to `5.3.2.201906051522-r` because gradle project is sometimes broken by `apache httpcomponents` in transitive dependency. ([#407](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/407))

## [3.23.0] - 2019-04-24
* Updated default ktlint from 0.21.0 to 0.32.0, and Maven coords to com.pinterest ([#394](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/394))

## [3.21.1] - 2019-03-29
* Fixes incorrect plugin and pom metadata in `3.21.0` ([#388](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/388)).

## [3.21.0] - 2019-03-28
* Updated default eclipse-wtp from 4.7.3b to 4.8.0 ([#382](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/382)).
* Updated default eclipse-groovy from 4.8.1 to 4.10.0 ([#382](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/382)).
* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.10.0 to 4.11.0 ([#384](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/384)).
* Fixed intermittent concurrency error while downloading formatter dependencies in multi-project builds ([#372](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/372)).

## [3.20.0] - 2019-03-11
* Made npm package versions of [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) and [`tsfmt`](https://github.com/vvakame/typescript-formatter) (and its internal packages) configurable. ([#363](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/363))
  * Updated default npm package version of `prettier` from 1.13.4 to 1.16.4
  * Updated default npm package version of internally used typescript package from 2.9.2 to 3.3.3 and tslint package from 5.1.0 to 5.12.0 (both used by `tsfmt`)
* Updated default eclipse-wtp from 4.7.3a to 4.7.3b ([#371](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/371)).
* Default behavior of XML formatter changed to ignore external URIs ([#369](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/369)).
  * **WARNING RESOLVED: By default, xml formatter no longer downloads external entities. You can opt-in to resolve external entities by setting resolveExternalURI to true. However, if you do opt-in, be sure that all external entities are referenced over https and not http, or you may be vulnerable to XXE attacks.**

## [3.19.0] - 2019-03-11
**WARNING: xml formatter in this version may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, fixed in 3.20.0 (see [#358](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/358)).**

* Security fix: Updated groovy, c/c++, and eclipse WTP formatters so that they download their source jars securely using `https` rather than `http` ([#360](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/360)).
* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.9.0 to 4.10.0 ([#368](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/368))

## [3.18.0] - 2019-02-11
**WARNING: xml formatter in this version may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, fixed in 3.20.0 (see [#358](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/358)).**

* Provided eclipse-wtp formatters in generic formatter extension. ([#325](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/325)). This change obsoletes the CSS and XML extensions.
* Improved configuration times for large projects (thanks to @oehme for finding [#348](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/348)).
* Updated default google-java-format from 1.5 to 1.7 ([#335](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/335)).
* Replacing a step no longer triggers early evaluation ([#219](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/219)).
* `importOrderFile(Object file)` for java and groovy is now lazy ([#218](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/218)).
* added `targetExclude(Object...)` which excludes the given files from processing ([#353](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/353)).
  * This resolves several related issues:
    * [#153](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/153) using a `PatternFilterable` to determine source processed by `JavaExtension` and `KotlinExtension`
    * [#194](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/194) ignoreErrorForPath does not work
    * [#324](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/324) better support for excluding files from processing
  * Our answer for a long time had been "just use `target(Object...)` to fix this" but there is clearly sufficient demand to justify `targetExclude`.

## [3.17.0] - 2018-12-13
**WARNING: xml formatter in this version may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, fixed in 3.20.0 (see [#358](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/358)).**

* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.7.3a to 4.9.0 ([#316](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/316)). New version addresses enum-tab formatting bug in 4.8 ([#314](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/314)).
* Added `-spotlessFiles` switch to allow targeting specific files ([#322](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/322))

## [3.16.0] - 2018-10-30
**WARNING: xml formatter in this version may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, fixed in 3.20.0 (see [#358](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/358)).**

* Fixed a bug in `LicenseHeaderStep` which caused an exception with some malformed date-aware licenses. ([#222](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/222))
* Updated default ktlint from 0.14.0 to 0.21.0
* Add ability to pass custom options to ktlint. See README for details.
* Added interface `HasBuiltinDelimiterForLicense` to language extensions that have pre-defined licence header delimiter. ([#235](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/235))

* LicenseHeader now supports time-aware license headers. ([docs](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle#license-header), [#179](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/179), thanks to @baptistemesta)

## [3.7.0] - 2017-12-02
* Updated default eclipse-jdt version to `4.7.1` from `4.6.3`.
* All spotless tasks now run before the `clean` task. ([#159](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/159))
* Added `sql` ([#166](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/166)) and `dbeaverSql`. ([#166](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/166))
  + Many thanks to [Baptiste Mesta](https://github.com/baptistemesta) for porting to Spotless.
  + Many thanks to [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.jkiss.org/) and the [DBeaver contributors](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/graphs/contributors) for building the implementation.

## [3.6.0] - 2017-09-29
* Fixes a rare up-to-date bug. ([#144](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/144) and [#146](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/146))

## [3.5.2] - 2017-09-05
* Fix licenseHeader so it works with Kotlin files starting with `@file:...` instead of `package ...` ([#136](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/136)).

## [3.5.1] - 2017-08-14
* Fixed `kotlinGradle` linting [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) files throwing `ParseException` ([#132](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/132)).

## [3.5.0] - 2017-08-13
* Changed `importOrder` interface from array to varargs ([#125](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/125)).
* The `kotlin` extension was mis-spelled as `kotin`.
* Added `kotlinGradle` method to `SpotlessExtension` for linting [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) files with [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint) ([#115](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/115))
* Added dedicated `groovyGradle` for formatting of Gradle files.

## [3.4.1] - 2017-07-11
* Default eclipse version for `EclipseFormatterStep` bumped to `4.6.3` from `4.6.1`. ([#116](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/116))
* Default scalafmt version for `ScalaFmtStep` bumped to `1.1.0` from `0.5.7` ([#124](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/124))
  + Also added support for the API change to scalafmt introduced in `0.7.0-RC1`
* Fixed wildcard targets for `includeFlat` subprojects ([#121](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/121))
* When spotless needs to download a formatter, it now uses the buildscript repositories specified in the root buildscript. ([#123](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/123), [#120](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/120))

## [3.4.0] - 2017-05-21
* `ImportOrderStep` can now handle multi-line comments and misplaced imports.
* Groovy extension now checks for the `groovy` plugin to be applied.
* Deprecated the old syntax for the the eclipse formatter:
  + New syntax better separates the version from the other configuration options, and is more consistent with the other
  + `eclipseFormatFile('format.xml')` -> `eclipse().configFile('format.xml')`
  + `eclipseFormatFile('4.4.0', 'format.xml')` -> `eclipse('4.4.0').configFile('format.xml')`

## [3.3.2] - 2017-05-03
* Fixed a bug in `paddedCell()` which caused `spotlessCheck` to fail even after `spotlessApply` for cases where a rule is misbehaving and causing a cycle.

## [3.3.0] - 2017-04-11
* Added support for groovy formatting (huge thanks to Frank Vennemeyer! [#94](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/94), [#89](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/89), [#88](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/88), [#85](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/85))
* When special-purpose formatters need to be downloaded from maven, they are now resolved using the buildscript repositories rather than the project repositories. (thanks to [cal101](https://github.com/cal101) [#100](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/100))

## [3.2.0] - 2017-04-03
* Update default KtLint from 0.3.1 to 0.6.1 (thanks to @kvnxiao [#93](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/93)).
  + This means we no longer look for rules in the typo package `com.gihub.shyiko`, now only in `com.github.shyiko` (note the `t`).
* Added an `enforceCheck` property which allows users to disable adding `spotlessCheck` as a dependency of `check` (thanks to @gdecaso [#95](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/95)).
* Any errors in a step will now fail the build] - 201x-xx-xx previously they were only warned.
  + We claimed that we implemented this in 3.1.0, but it was broken.  We really fixed it this time.

## [3.1.0] - 2017-02-27
* Added support for Scala via [scalafmt](https://github.com/olafurpg/scalafmt).
* Added support for Kotlin via [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint).
* Added `FormatExtension::replaceStep`.
* `paddedCell()` is no longer required if a misbehaving rule converges.
* Any errors in a step will now fail the build] - 201x-xx-xx previously they were only warned.
* Added `FormatExtension::ignoreErrorForStep` and `FormatExtension::ignoreErrorForPath`.
* Bumped `google-java-format` to `1.3`.

## [3.0.0] - 2017-01-09
* BREAKING CHANGE: `customReplace` and `customReplaceRegex` renamed to just `replace` and `replaceRegex`.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Plugin portal ID is still `com.diffplug.gradle.spotless`, but maven coordinate has changed to `com.diffplug.spotless:spotless-plugin-gradle`.
* HUGE SPEEDUP: Now supports incremental build / up-to-date-checking.
  + If you are using `custom` or `customLazy`, you might want to take a look at [this javadoc](https://javadoc.io/static/com.diffplug.spotless/spotless-plugin-gradle/3.27.0/com/diffplug/gradle/spotless/FormatExtension.html#bumpThisNumberIfACustomStepChanges-int-).
* BREAKING CHANGE: `freshmark` no longer includes all project properties by default.  All properties must now be added manually:

```gradle
spotless {
  freshmark {
    propertiesFile('gradle.properties')
    properties {
      it.put('key', 'value')
    }
  }
}
```

* Fixed googleJavaFormat so that it can now sort imports and remove unused imports.
* Added an à la carte `removeUnusedImports()` step.

## [2.4.1] - 2017-01-02
* Java files under the `src/main/groovy` folder are now formatted by default. ([Issue #59](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/59), [PR #60](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/60), thanks @ajoberstar).

## [2.4.0] - 2016-11-01
* If a formatter step throws an `Error` or any of its subclasses, such as the `AssertionError`s thrown by JUnit, AssertJ, etc. that error will kill the build ([#46](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/46))
  + This allows custom rules like this:

```gradle
custom 'no swearing', {
  if (it.toLowerCase().contains('fubar')) {
    throw new AssertionError('No swearing!');
  }
}
```

## [2.3.0] - 2016-10-27
* When `spotlessCheck` fails, the error message now contains a short diff of what is neccessary to fix the issue ([#10](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/10), thanks to Jonathan Bluett-Duncan).
* Added a [padded-cell mode](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/master/PADDEDCELL.md) which allows spotless to band-aid over misbehaving rules, and generate error reports for these rules (See [#37](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/37) for an example).
* Character encoding is now configurable (spotless-global or format-by-format).
* Line endings were previously only spotless-global, they now also support format-by-format.
* Upgraded eclipse formatter from 4.6.0 to 4.6.1

## [2.2.0] - 2016-10-07
* Added support for [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).

```
spotless {
  java {
    googleJavaFormat()  // googleJavaFormat('1.1') to specify a specific version
  }
}
```

## [2.1.0] - 2016-10-07
* Added the method `FormatExtension::customLazyGroovy` which fixes the Groovy closure problem.

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-16
* `spotlessApply` now writes out a file only if it needs to be changed (big performance improvement).
* Java import sorting now removes duplicate imports.
* Eclipse formatter now warns if the formatter xml contains multiple profiles.
* Updated eclipse formatter to Eclipse Neon (4.6).
* BREAKING CHANGE: Eclipse formatter now formats javadoc comments.
  + You might want to look at the following settings in your `spotless.eclipseformat.xml`:

```
org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.join_lines_in_comments=true/false
org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.comment.format_javadoc_comments=true/false
org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.comment.format_line_comments=true/false
org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.comment.format_block_comments=true/false
```

The most important breaking change of 2.0 is the new default line ending mode, `GIT_ATTRIBUTES`.  This line ending mode copies git's behavior exactly.  This change should require no intervention from users, and should be significantly easier to adopt for users who are already using `.gitattributes` or the `core.eol` property.

If you aren't using git, you can still use `.gitattributes` files for fine-grained control of line endings.  If no git information is found, it behaves the same as PLATFORM_NATIVE (the old default).

Below is the algorithm used by git and spotless to determine the proper line ending for a file.  As soon as a step succeeds in finding a line ending, the other steps will not take place.

1. If the code is a git repository, look in the `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes` file for the `eol` attribute.
2. Look at the `.gitattributes` in the file's directory, going up the directory tree.
3. Look at the global `.gitattributes` file, if any.
4. Look at the `core.eol` property in the git config (looking first at repo-specific, then user-specific, then system-specific).
5. Use the PLATFORM_NATIVE line ending.

## [1.3.3] - 2016-03-10
* Upgraded Eclipse formatter to 4.5.2, which fixes [37 bugs](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&short_desc=%5Bformatter%5D&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&target_milestone=4.5.1&target_milestone=4.5.2) compared to the previous 4.5.0.
* If you have been using `custom 'Lambda fix', { it.replace('} )', '})').replace('} ,', '},') }`, you don't need it anymore.

## [1.3.2] - 2015-12-17
* Spotless no longer clobbers package-info.java, fixes [#1](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/1).
* Added some infrastructure which allows `FormatterStep`s to peek at the filename if they really need to.

## [1.3.1] - 2015-09-22
* Bumped the FreshMark dependency to 1.3.0, because it offers improved error reporting.

## [1.3.0] - 2015-09-22
* Added native support for FreshMark.

## [1.2.0] - 2015-08-25
* Updated from Eclipse 4.5 M6 to the official Eclipse 4.5 release, which fixes several bugs in the formatter.
* Fixed a bug in the import sorter which made it impossible to deal with "all unmatched type imports".
* Formatting is now relative to the project directory rather than the root directory.
* Improved the logging levels.

## [1.1] - 2015-05-14
* No functional changes, probably not worth the time for an upgrade.
* First version which is available on plugins.gradle.org as well as jcenter.
* Removed some code that was copy-pasted from Durian, and added a Durian dependency.

## [1.0] - 2015-04-29
* Initial release.

## [0.1] - 2015-04-28
* First release, to test out that we can release to jcenter and whatnot.
