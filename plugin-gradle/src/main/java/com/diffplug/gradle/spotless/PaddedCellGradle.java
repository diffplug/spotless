/**
 * Incorporates the PaddedCell machinery into SpotlessTask.apply() and SpotlessTask.check().
 *
 * Here's the general workflow:
 *
 * ### Identify that paddedCell is needed
 *
 * Initially, paddedCell is off.  That's the default, and there's no need for users to know about it.
 *
 * If they encounter a scenario where `spotlessCheck` fails after calling `spotlessApply`, then they would
 * justifiably be frustrated.  Luckily, every time `spotlessCheck` fails, it passes the failed files to
 * {@link #anyMisbehave(Formatter, List)}, which checks to see if any of the rules are causing a cycle
 * or some other kind of mischief.  If they are, it throws a special error message,
 * {@link #youShouldTurnOnPaddedCell(SpotlessTask)} which tells them to turn on paddedCell.
 *
 * ### spotlessCheck with paddedCell on
 *
 * Spotless check behaves as normal, finding a list of problem files, but then passes that list
 * to {@link #check(SpotlessTask, Formatter, List)}.  If there were no problem files, then `paddedCell`
 * is no longer necessary, so users might as well turn it off, so we give that info as a warning.
