* Made npm package versions of [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) and [`tsfmt`](https://github.com/vvakame/typescript-formatter) (and its internal packages) configurable. ([#363](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/363))

**WARNING: xml formatter in this version may be vulnerable to XXE attacks, fixed in 1.20.0 (see [#358](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/358)).**

* Added C/C++ support ([#232](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/232)).
* Integrated Eclipse CDT formatter ([#274](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/274))
* Extended dependency provisioner to exclude transitives on request ([#297](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/297)).This prevents unnecessary downloads of unused transitive dependencies for Eclipse based formatter steps.
* Updated default groovy-eclipse from 4.8.0 to 4.8.1 ([#288](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/288)). New version is based on [Groovy-Eclipse 3.0.0](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki/3.0.0-Release-Notes).

The reason for this change is so that `FormatterFunc.Closeable` actually works. ([#284](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/284))* Added [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) and [`tsfmt`](https://github.com/vvakame/typescript-formatter) support, as well as general infrastructure for calling `nodeJS` code using `j2v8` ([#283](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/283)).

* Updated default groovy-eclipse from 4.6.3 to 4.8.0 ([#244](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/244)). New version allows to ignore internal formatter errors/warnings.
* Updated default eclipse-jdt from 4.7.2 to 4.8.0 ([#239](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/239)). New version fixes a bug preventing Java code formatting within JavaDoc comments ([#191](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/191)).
* Eclipse formatter versions decoupled from Spotless formatter step implementations to allow independent updates of maven-based Eclipse dependencies. ([#253](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/253))
