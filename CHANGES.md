### Version 1.15.0-SNAPSHOT - TBD (javadoc [lib](https://diffplug.github.io/spotless/javadoc/spotless-lib/snapshot/) [lib-extra](https://diffplug.github.io/spotless/javadoc/spotless-lib-extra/snapshot/), [snapshot repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/diffplug/spotless/))

* Updated JSR305 annotation from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2 ([#274](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/274))
* Migrated from FindBugs annotations 3.0.0 to SpotBugs annotations 3.1.6 ([#274](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/274))
* `Formatter` now implements `AutoCloseable`.  This means that users of `Formatter` are expected to use the try-with-resources pattern.  The reason for this change is so that `FormatterFunc.Closeable` actually works. ([#284](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/284))
