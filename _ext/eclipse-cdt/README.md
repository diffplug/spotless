# spotless-cdt-eclipse

Eclipse CDT is not available in a form which can be easily consumed by maven or gradle.  To fix this, we publish Eclipse's formatter and all its dependencies, along with a small amount of glue code, into the `com.diffplug.gradle.spotless:spotless-ext-eclipse-cdt` artifact.

To publish a new version, update the `_ext/eclipse-cdt/gradle.properties` appropriately and run this from the root directory:

```
gradlew -b _ext/eclipse-cdt/build.gradle publish
```

Spotless at large is under the Apache 2.0 license, but this jar is under the EPL v1.
