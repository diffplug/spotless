//Compiler error. Missing close-brace.
//
//Note that the error message is additionally logged to system-err
//within GrEclipse itself. That error message is just a dump of a RAW data report.
//The whole error handling therefore looks not nicely readable.
//Since these errors should only occur if the input file is not compile-able,
//the error format is considered acceptable, since the spotless task runs 
//in general only after a successful compilation.
